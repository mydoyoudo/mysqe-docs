Hello world! Welcome to my digital home.

**Why I'm doing this:**
The digital nomad lifestyle combines the best of technology, freedom, and global perspective. I want to share what I've learned and connect with others on similar journeys.

**What's coming:**
- Technical tutorials and project showcases
- Investment strategy deep-dives
- Travel guides and cost comparisons
- Tool reviews and digital setup guides

*Building the future, one project at a time.*
